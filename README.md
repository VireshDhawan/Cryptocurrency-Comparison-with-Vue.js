# cryptocompare

CryptoCompare is a static website that compares cryptocurrency prices for
popular currencies.

It uses plain old HTML, Javascript, and CSS to render a very simple, one page
application that shows you:

- The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap
- All cryptocurrency prices over the last hour, day, and week

This is useful for people interested in speculating on the cryptocurrency
marketplaces, as you can take a look at short term performance to get a feel for
how you'd like to speculate.
